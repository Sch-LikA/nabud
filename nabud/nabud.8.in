.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a server for NABU Personal Computers.
The NABU Personal Computer is a Z80-based machine system sold briefly
in Canada in the early 1980s that downloaded all of its software from
participating cable TV networks using an external appliance called
the
.Dq Adaptor .
The NABU was connected to the Adaptor using an RS422 serial interface
running at 111,000 baud and sent requests to the Adaptor for indiviual
segments of numbered images.
The communication with the cable TV network was one-way, so the content
was broadcast in a continuous
.Dq cycle ;
the Adaptor simply waited for the requested packet to arrive, at which
point it was relayed to the waiting NABU.
The content was interleaved such that retrieving the next segment of
a particular image did not incur an excessively long wait time.
The Adaptor itself was relatively simple and did very little local
processing beyond extremely basic packet filtering and that could be
achieved on a Motorola 6801 MCU.
The serial interface was based around the Western Digital TR1863P UART.
.Pp
.Nm
emulates the original Adaptor protocol and has the following features:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Serve pre-packetized
.Dq pak
files.
These files can be unencrypted or encrypted using the NabuRetroNet scheme.
This is the format used to vend the orginal NABU Network cycles from 1984.
.It
Serve flat
.Dq nabu
files.
These files are flat binaries that are loaded into a fixed memory
location by the NABU ROM.
.It
Flexible configuration model that allows up to 254 content
.Dq channels
from an arbitrary number of
.Dq sources .
.It
Serve an arbitrary number of NABU PCs, limited only by the number of
serial ports you can connect to the server.
.It
Serve an arbitrary number of simulated NABU PCs
.Pq for example, MAME
on the local machine or on your local network over TCP/IP.
.It
Selection of per-connection alternative files
.Pq and a per-channel default file
to be served to the
NABU when the NABU ROM requests image 000001
.Pq the boot image .
.It
A control program,
.Xr nabuctl 1 ,
that lets you get information about channels and connections, as well as
list the contents if the NabuRetroNet
.Dq HomeBrew
channel and select different files to be loaded by the NABU.
.It
Support for the NABU HCCA Application Communication Protocol.
NHACP is a new protocol extension under active development that
allows programs running on the NABU to access remote storage.
.It
Minimal privilege requirements.
.Nm
requires the ability to open serial ports for reading and writing in
order to communicate with NABU PCs.
If only TCP/IP is used,
.Nm
requires no special privileges.
.It
Extremely portable implementation that relies mainly on standard
POSIX and C99 interfaces and keeps external dependencies to a
minimum.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
accepts the following options:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl c Ar conf
Specifies an alternative location for the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It Fl d
Enables extremely verbose debugging messages.
This option also implies the
.Fl f
option.
.It Fl f
Runs
.Nm
in the foreground.
Without this option,
.Nm
detaches from the controlling terminal and runs as a daemon.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Tells
.Nm
to write log messages to the specified log file.
By default,
.Nm
logs all messages to the system log using
.Xr syslog 3
with the
.Dv LOG_USER
facility.
Note that when
.Fl f
is specified, all log message are written to the controlling terminal.
.It Fl u Ar user
Specifies an alternative user ID to run
.Nm
as.
Use of this option to specify a minimally-privileged user is highly
recommended.
This option is ignored if
.Nm
is not started as the super-user.
.It Fl U Ar umask
Specifes the file creation mask to use when creating files.
File creation on the server is suppored by the NHACP protocol.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
requires a configuration file in order to run.
The configuration file is a JSON-format dictionary with three stanzas in
the following order:
.Bl -tag -width "Connections"
.It Sources
An array of objects that define channel sources.
.It Channels
An array of objects that define the content channels available to
connected NABUs.
.It Connections
An array of objects that define the NABU connections
.Po
either serial connections to real hardware or TCP/IP connections to emulators
.Pc .
.El
.Pp
The next subsections describe the individual stanzas and the object
definitions they contain.
The described object properties are required unless specified otherwise.
.Ss Sources
The
.Dq Sources
stanza is an array of source objects.
Each source object has the following properties:
.Bl -tag -width "Location"
.It Name
A string that specifies the name of the source.
.It Location
A string that specifies the location of the source.
The location may be a local path name or a URL.
.El
.Ss Channels
The
.Dq Channels
stanza is an array of channel objects.
Each channel object has the following properties:
.Bl -tag -width "DefaultFile"
.It Name
A string that specifies the name of the channel.
In addition to being the name displayed to the user, this is
default subdirectory relative to the root of the source that
contains the content for the channel.
.It Path
An optional string that specifies the path relative to the root
of the source that contains the content for the channel.
.It Number
A number between 1 and 255 that specifies the channel's number.
.It Type
A string that specifies if the channel contains
.Dq pak
or
.Dq nabu
files.
.It Source
A string that specifies the source of the channel.
.It ListURL
An optional string that specifies a listing file in the format
used by NabuRetroNet that lists the content of the channel.
This listing can be viewed by
.Xr nabuctl 1 ,
which can then also select these files for download on individual
connections.
.It DefaultFile
An optional string that specifes a default file to be loaded when
the NABU ROM requests image 000001.
Indiviual connections can override this by selecting a different file.
.El
.Ss Connections
The
.Dq Connections
stanza is an array of connection objects.
Each connection object has the following properties:
.Bl -tag -width "FileRoot"
.It Type
A string that specifies if the connection type, either
.Dq serial
or
.Dq tcp .
.It Port
A string that specifies the connect port.
For
.Dq serial
connections, this is the path to the serial port's device special file,
for example
.Dq /dev/ttyU0 .
For
.Dq tcp
connections, this is the TCP port number on which
.Nm
will listen for incoming connections from NABU emulators.
.It Channel
An optional number between 1 and 255 that specifies the connection's
default channel.
.It FileRoot
An optional string that specifies the local file storage root for
this connection.
This option must be specified if you wish to use the NHACP storage
extensions.
